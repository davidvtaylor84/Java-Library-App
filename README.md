# Far Sky 11 Science-Fiction Library

## This library system was built using:

* Java
* IntelliJ

## Description
I have created a simple library system demonstrating aspects of Java I have learned since the end of the course (including lambdas and streams). Books and members can be added, books can be loaned out, titles can be listed and searched for etc.

* CRUD functionality on books and library members.
* Use of Object Orientated Programming in the creation of classes and functions belonging to certain classes.
* Log-in and Password system in place so only library staff can use this app.
* The app calculates overdue fees and does not allow members to borrow books if their late fees are over a certain amount.
* Simple yet intuitive interface design.

## Installation
Open Java-Library-App in IDE, then run LibraryApp.
